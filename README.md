# Introduction

This github helps you understand the basics of NLP, architectures like RNN, LSTM and advanced ones like Transformers and Self Attention.  

These topics are important to get you started. Code contains very simple explaination that you can use to build up your knowledge on such complex topics.

I always had trouble understanding and transforming the inputs to feed to neural network so this is my attempt to help those who were as clueless as I was when I first started.

We will first understand Matrix and Tensors, followed by simple code for each of the architectures. Basic understanding of NN, gates, attention etc.
The code presented here does not have any end to end implementation but just enough to understand the missing ingredients. 

One of the biggest challenge is to indefity input shape. lets start with that first!

Enjoy!!

`learning path to be added - image to be added tomorrow`  
`add basics of arrays and matrix from Notion notes`    
`section on input shape of each of the architecture covered here`  
`code section should have all py file or ipynb file or maybe dagshub?`
